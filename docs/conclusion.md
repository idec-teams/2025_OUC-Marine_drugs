# Conclusion

<div class="content">&nbsp&nbspIn this study, by using a reported CYP152 family P450<sub>SPα</sub> as the probe, P450<sub>S18</sub>
was mined from a deep sea-derived bacteria. P450<sub>S18</sub> can directly transform 
OPD (1) to 2,3-diaminophenazine (2) through C‒N bond construction, in the 
presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. We analyzed the possible residues that may be closely 
related to the binding of OPD (1) in P450<sub>S18</sub>, and used alanine scanning to 
engineer them. All of the mutants exhibited 1.5~3.5-fold increased activity with 
F292A as the optimal mutant. Phenazines are heterocyclic nitrogenous 
aromatics with a dibenzopytazine core. They have a wide range of bioactivities, 
and Cedomon and Shenqinmycin have been approved as biopesticide. The 
formation of natural phenazines need multiple steps and enzymes, while 
P450<sub>S18</sub> could directly construct 2,3-diaminophenazine (2) using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. 
Therefore, P450<sub>S18</sub> could be exploited as a tool enzyme in synthesizing 
phenazine derivatives with good bioactivities.
