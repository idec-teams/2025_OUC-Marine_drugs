# Abstract

<div class="content">Deep sea-derived microbes are great sources for novel enzymes due to their 
extreme living environment, such as high pressure, high salinity, etc. CYP152 
family P450s have the ability to directly use H2O2 instead of complex redox 
partners, which have high biocatalytic values in biofuels and fine chemical 
synthesis. Therefore, in this project, we mined a CYP152 family P450S18 from 
a deep sea-derived bacteria and improved its catalytic ability toward 1,2-
phenylenediamine (OPD, 1). In vitro assays showed that P450S18 can directly 
transform OPD (1) to 2,3-diaminophenazine (2) through Câ€’N bond construction, 
in the presence of H2O2. We then performed protein structure prediction and 
molecular docking of OPD with P450S18, and selected eight binding-related 
residues for further study. Alanine scanning and crude enzyme activity 
screening indicated F295A, P246A, F176A, F292A, F82A, and Q88A can 
effectively increase the catalytic activity. Finally, we purified the mutants and 
accurately measured their in vitro catalytic efficiency toward OPD (1). All of the 
mutants exhibited 1.5~3.5-fold increased activity with F292A as the optimal 
mutant. Our study provides foundation for further engineering of P450S18 to 
obtain phenazine derivatives.</div>
