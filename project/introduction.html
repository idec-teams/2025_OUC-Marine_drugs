            <p>&nbsp&nbspDeep sea represents the largest ecosystem on Earth yet less explored.
                Characterized by its extreme physicochemical conditions such as high pressure,
                low temperature, high salinity and chemical toxicity, deep-sea environment
                harbors unique microbial communities.<sup>[1]</sup> Recent studies have demonstrated
                that deep-sea microorganisms are significant sources of novel enzymes with
                unprecedented functions.<sup>[2]</sup> Enzymes produced by deep-sea microorganisms
                span a wide range of categories, including proteases, lipases, methane
                monooxygenases, PETase, P450 enzymes, etc. These enzymes exhibit unique
                catalytic properties under long-term adaption of the harsh environment.<sup>[1][3]</sup>
                Therefore, mining and engineering of the enzymes from deep-sea derived
                microbes could be an efficient way to obtain tool enzymes applied in green
                biomanufacturing.<sup>[4]</sup></p>


            <p>&nbsp&nbspCytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) are a superfamily of heme-containing
                oxygenases found in all kingdoms of life. They have a common structural fold
                with a heme-iron center held by a cysteine residue, which is key for their
                activity.<sup>[5]</sup> P450s show great functional versatility, catalyzing diverse reactions
                like hydroxylation, epoxidation, dealkylation, decarboxylation, C–C bond
                cleavage, and even rare ones like nitration and amination.<sup>[6]</sup> This wide range of
                functions makes them useful in pharmaceuticals production (like drug
                modification and metabolism, steroid synthesis), biofuel production (like
                alkenes production), pollutant degradation (like xenobiotics break down), and
                fine chemical synthesis (like unsaturated hydrocarbons direct nitration).<sup>[7]</sup>
                Improving the catalytic abilities of P450s through protein design and directed
                evolution keeps increasing their use in sustainable biocatalysis and synthetic
                biology.</p>


            <p>&nbsp&nbspA vast majority of P450s rely on external redox partner(s) to transfer electrons
                for O<sub>2</sub> activation, making the reaction systems complicated and
                uneconomical.<sup>[8,9]</sup> Noticeably, CYP152 family P450s have evolved the ability to
                directly use H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> instead of redox partners via the peroxide shunt pathway.<sup>[9,10]</sup>
                The representative enzymes of CYP152 family P450s, which were widely
                studied, were P450<sub>SPα</sub> (Sphingomonas paucimobilis), P450<sub>BSβ</sub> (Bacillus
                subtilis), and P450<sub>OleT</sub> (Jeotgalicoccus sp.). P450<sub>SPα</sub> and P450<sub>BSβ</sub> catalyze the
                α- or β-hydroxylation of fatty acids, while P450<sub>OleT</sub>> efficiently produces terminal
                alkenes from fatty acids by decarboxylation. Mechanistical studies have shown
                that these three enzymes activate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> via substrate-assisted heterolysis to
                generate Compound I, which is the key oxidizing intermediate.<sup>[10-12]</sup> All of these
                traits give CYP152 family P450s high biocatalytic value in biofuels area and fine
                chemical synthesis. </p>

            <p>&nbsp&nbspHerein, in this study, we mined a CYP152 family P450<sub>S18</sub> from a deepsea-derived
                bacteria and used semi-rational directed evolution to improve its
                catalytic ability toward 1,2-phenylenediamine (OPD, 1). We first evaluated the
                in vitro activity P450S18, and found it could transform OPD (1) to 2,3-
                diaminophenazine (2) through C‒N bond construction. Then the possible amino
                acids relating to the binding of OPD (1) in P450<sub>S18</sub> were analyzed. Furthermore,
                we used alanine scanning, crude enzyme reaction activity screening to find
                variants with higher catalytic activities. Finally, the selected variants were
                purified and their catalytic efficiencies were measured, in which F295A, P246A,
                F176A, F292A, F82A, and Q88A showed 1.5-3.5-fold increased activity (Fig 1)</p>
