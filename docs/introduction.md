&nbsp&nbspDeep sea represents the largest ecosystem on Earth yet less explored. 
Characterized by its extreme physicochemical conditions such as high pressure, 
low temperature, high salinity and chemical toxicity, deep-sea environment 
harbors unique microbial communities.[1] Recent studies have demonstrated 
that deep-sea microorganisms are significant sources of novel enzymes with 
unprecedented functions.[2] Enzymes produced by deep-sea microorganisms 
span a wide range of categories, including proteases, lipases, methane 
monooxygenases, PETase, P450 enzymes, etc. These enzymes exhibit unique 
catalytic properties under long-term adaption of the harsh environment.[1][3]
Therefore, mining and engineering of the enzymes from deep-sea derived 
microbes could be an efficient way to obtain tool enzymes applied in green 
biomanufacturing.[4]
&nbsp&nbspCytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) are a superfamily of heme-containing 
oxygenases found in all kingdoms of life. They have a common structural fold 
with a heme-iron center held by a cysteine residue, which is key for their 
activity.[5] P450s show great functional versatility, catalyzing diverse reactions 
like hydroxylation, epoxidation, dealkylation, decarboxylation, C–C bond 
cleavage, and even rare ones like nitration and amination.[6] This wide range of 
functions makes them useful in pharmaceuticals production (like drug 
modification and metabolism, steroid synthesis), biofuel production (like 
alkenes production), pollutant degradation (like xenobiotics break down), and 
fine chemical synthesis (like unsaturated hydrocarbons direct nitration).[7]
Improving the catalytic abilities of P450s through protein design and directed 
evolution keeps increasing their use in sustainable biocatalysis and synthetic 
biology.
&nbsp&nbspA vast majority of P450s rely on external redox partner(s) to transfer electrons 
for O<sub>2</sub> activation, making the reaction systems complicated and 
uneconomical.[8,9] Noticeably, CYP152 family P450s have evolved the ability to 
directly use H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> instead of redox partners via the peroxide shunt pathway.[9,10]
The representative enzymes of CYP152 family P450s, which were widely 
studied, were P450<sub>SPα</sub> (Sphingomonas paucimobilis), P450<sub>BSβ</sub> (Bacillus 
subtilis), and P450<sub>OleT</sub> (Jeotgalicoccus sp.). P450<sub>SPα</sub> and P450<sub>BSβ</sub> catalyze the 
α- or β-hydroxylation of fatty acids, while P450<sub>OleT</sub>> efficiently produces terminal 
alkenes from fatty acids by decarboxylation. Mechanistical studies have shown 
that these three enzymes activate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> via substrate-assisted heterolysis to 
generate Compound I, which is the key oxidizing intermediate.[10-12] All of these 
traits give CYP152 family P450s high biocatalytic value in biofuels area and fine 
chemical synthesis. 
&nbsp&nbspHerein, in this study, we mined a CYP152 family P450<sub>S18</sub> from a deepsea-derived 
bacteria and used semi-rational directed evolution to improve its 
catalytic ability toward 1,2-phenylenediamine (OPD, 1). We first evaluated the 
in vitro activity P450S18, and found it could transform OPD (1) to 2,3-
diaminophenazine (2) through C‒N bond construction. Then the possible amino 
acids relating to the binding of OPD (1) in P450<sub>S18</sub> were analyzed. Furthermore, 
we used alanine scanning, crude enzyme reaction activity screening to find 
variants with higher catalytic activities. Finally, the selected variants were 
purified and their catalytic efficiencies were measured, in which F295A, P246A, 
F176A, F292A, F82A, and Q88A showed 1.5-3.5-fold increased activity (Fig 1)
