            <h3><em>In vitro</em> activity of P450<sub>S18</sub></h3>
            <p>&nbsp&nbspUsing the CYP152 family P450 enzyme P450<sub>SPα</sub> as the probe, a homolog
                protein P450<sub>S18</sub> was successfully identified from a deepsea-derived
                microorganism. We then amplified the sequences encoding P450<sub>S18</sub>, and
                cloned it into pET28a. The soluble form of P450<sub>S18</sub> (48.4 KDa) were obtained
                in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (Fig S1). We then tested the catalytic activities
                of P450<sub>S18</sub> toward different small molecule compounds containing benzene
                rings (Fig S2), using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as the cofactor. Surprisingly, in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,
                P450<sub>S18</sub> could transform OPD (1) to 2,3-diaminophenazine (2) (Fig 2).
                Phenazines are a class of heterocyclic nitrogenous aromatics featuring a
                dibenzopytazine core.<sup>[13]</sup> These compounds displayed a wide range of
                bioactivities, including antimicrobial, antifungal, antitumor, etc.
                <sup>[13]</sup>
                It is reported
                that the formation of natural phenazines need multiple steps and enzymes.<sup>[14]</sup>
                While P450<sub>S18</sub> could transform OPD (1) to 2,3-diaminophenazine (2) directly
                through C‒N bond construction, demonstrating its potential use for phenazines
                construction. Therefore, we next engineered P450<sub>S18</sub> for better catalytic
                activities toward the substrate OPD (1).

            <h3>Identification of the candidate residues of P450<sub>S18</sub> for directed evolution</h3>
            <p>&nbsp&nbspTo investigate the potential substrate binding residues in P450<sub>S18</sub>, we first
                modeled its protein structure using Alphafold 3. P450<sub>S18</sub> adopted a typical
                triangular-shaped P450-fold. Furthermore, we constructed a substrate binding
                model of two OPD (1) molecules in P450<sub>S18</sub> through Autodock vina. As shown
                in Fig 3, two OPD molecules were present in front of the heme center. The
                amino groups of two substrates form hydrogen bonds with Thr296, Phe295,
                Gln88 and Arg245. Moreover, the substrates were stabilized through lots of p-
                π and π-π interactions with Phe295, Phe292, Phe176, Pro246 and Phe82.
                Based on the substrate binding modes, we speculate that these residues may
                be involved in the catalytic activity of P450<sub>S18</sub> toward OPD (1). Therefore, we
                selected Phe295, Arg245, Pro246, Phe176, Phe292, Phe82, Gln88 and Thr296
                for further directed evolution studies.</p>

            <p> &nbsp&nbsp<strong>Figure 3. Binding modes of the P450<sub>S18</sub> with OPD (1).</strong>The substrate OPD
                was shown as green sticks; the heme center was shown as magenta sticks;
                and the residues of P450<sub>S18</sub> were depicted as cyan sticks.</p>
            <h3>Alanine scanning and reaction activity screening of mutants</h3>
            <p>&nbsp&nbspWe then used alanine scanning of the substrate binding-related residues to
                engineer P450<sub>S18</sub>. We constructed seven mutants F82A, Q88A, F176A, P246A,
                R245A, F295A, T296A andF292A. Reverse complementary primers with
                mutation sites were designed to amplify the linear expression plasmids
                (pET28a/P450<sub>S18</sub>) with mutated sequences. The resulting linear plasmids were
                ligated to circular molecules by seamless cloning, and then introduced into E.
                coli BL21 (DE<sub>3</sub>). The expression strains were individually cultured, followed by
                addition of 0.2 mM IPTG to induce protein expression (Fig S3). Crude enzymes
                from each expression strain was incubated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and OPD (1) for 2 h, and
                the generation of 2,3-diaminophenazine (2) was detected by HPLC. As shown
                in Fig 4, compared to that of the wild-type P450<sub>S18</sub>, the catalytic activities of
                F295A, P246A, F176A, F292A, F82A, and Q88A toward OPD (1) increased by
                ~2-5 fold (Fig 4).

            <p> &nbsp&nbsp<strong>Figure 4. The relative activities of the crude enzymes of P450<sub>S18</sub> and its
                variants.</strong></p>
            <h3><em>In vitro</em> characterization of the P450<sub>S18</sub> variants F295A, P246A, F176A,
                F292A, F82A and Q88A</h3>
            <p>&nbsp&nbspIn order to accurately evaluate the catalytic efficiencies of the variants selected,
                we purified the P450<sub>S18</sub> variants F295A, P246A, F176A, F292A, F82A and
                Q88A (Fig S4). We tested the catalytic activities of the mutants and wild-type
                enzyme toward OPD (1) in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O</sub>2</sub>. As shown in Fig 5, compared
                to the wild-type enzyme, all of the selected mutants increased the catalytic
                efficiency toward OPD (1). F82A and Q88A increased by ~1.5-fold; F295A,
                P246A and F176A increased by ~2.2-fold; while F292A exhibited the highest
                catalytic ability, which increased by ~3.5-fold. We proposed that the increased
                activities of mutants may due to the reduction of steric hindrance. These results
                indicated that engineering of the binding residues could significantly increase
                the catalytic activity of P450<sub>S18</sub> toward OPD (1).</p>
