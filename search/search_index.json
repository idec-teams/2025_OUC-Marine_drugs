Therefore, in this project, we mined a CYP152 family P450S18 from  a deep sea-derived bacteria and improved its catalytic ability toward 1,2- phenylenediamine (OPD, 1). In vitro assays showed that P450S18 can directly  transform OPD (1) to 2,3-diaminophenazine (2) through C\u2012N bond construction,  in the presence of H2O2. We then performed protein structure prediction and  molecular docking of OPD with P450S18, and selected eight binding-related  residues for further study. Alanine scanning and crude enzyme activity  screening indicated F295A, P246A, F176A, F292A, F82A, and Q88A can  effectively increase the catalytic activity. Finally, we purified the mutants and  accurately measured their in vitro catalytic efficiency toward OPD (1). All of the  mutants exhibited 1.5~3.5-fold increased activity with F292A as the optimal  mutant. Our study provides foundation for further engineering of P450S18 to  obtain phenazine derivatives."},{"location":"author_introduction/","title":"Author Introduction","text":"\u81ea\u884c\u6dfb\u52a0\u5185\u5bb9"},{"location":"conclusion/","title":"Conclusion","text":"In this study, by using a reported CYP152 family P450<sub>SP\u03b1</sub> as the probe, P450<sub>S18</sub> was mined from a deep sea-derived bacteria.

Characterized by its extreme physicochemical conditions such as high pressure,  low temperature, high salinity and chemical toxicity, deep-sea environment  harbors unique microbial communities.[1] Recent studies have demonstrated  that deep-sea microorganisms are significant sources of novel enzymes with  unprecedented functions.[2] Enzymes produced by deep-sea microorganisms  span a wide range of categories, including proteases, lipases, methane  monooxygenases, PETase, P450 enzymes, etc. These enzymes exhibit unique  catalytic properties under long-term adaption of the harsh environment.[1][3] Therefore, mining and engineering of the enzymes from deep-sea derived  microbes could be an efficient way to obtain tool enzymes applied in green  biomanufacturing.[4] \u00a0\u00a0Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) are a superfamily of heme-containing  oxygenases found in all kingdoms of life. They have a common structural fold  with a heme-iron center held by a cysteine residue, which is key for their  activity.[5] P450s show great functional versatility, catalyzing diverse reactions  like hydroxylation, epoxidation, dealkylation, decarboxylation, C\u2013C bond  cleavage, and even rare ones like nitration and amination.[6] This wide range of  functions makes them useful in pharmaceuticals production (like drug  modification and metabolism, steroid synthesis), biofuel production (like  alkenes production), pollutant degradation (like xenobiotics break down), and  fine chemical synthesis (like unsaturated hydrocarbons direct nitration).[7] Improving the catalytic abilities of P450s through protein design and directed  evolution keeps increasing their use in sustainable biocatalysis and synthetic  biology. \u00a0\u00a0A vast majority of P450s rely on external redox partner(s) to transfer electrons  for O<sub>2</sub> activation, making the reaction systems complicated and  uneconomical.[8,9] Noticeably, CYP152 family P450s have evolved the ability to  directly use H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> instead of redox partners via the peroxide shunt pathway.[9,10] The representative enzymes of CYP152 family P450s, which were widely  studied, were P450<sub>SP\u03b1</sub> (Sphingomonas paucimobilis), P450<sub>BS\u03b2</sub> (Bacillus  subtilis), and P450<sub>OleT</sub> (Jeotgalicoccus sp.). P450<sub>SP\u03b1</sub> and P450<sub>BS\u03b2</sub> catalyze the  \u03b1- or \u03b2-hydroxylation of fatty acids, while P450<sub>OleT</sub>&gt; efficiently produces terminal  alkenes from fatty acids by decarboxylation. Mechanistical studies have shown  that these three enzymes activate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> via substrate-assisted heterolysis to  generate Compound I, which is the key oxidizing intermediate.[10-12] All of these  traits give CYP152 family P450s high biocatalytic value in biofuels area and fine  chemical synthesis.  \u00a0\u00a0Herein, in this study, we mined a CYP152 family P450<sub>S18</sub> from a deepsea-derived  bacteria and used semi-rational directed evolution to improve its  catalytic ability toward 1,2-phenylenediamine (OPD, 1). We first evaluated the  in vitro activity P450S18, and found it could transform OPD (1) to 2,3- diaminophenazine (2) through C\u2012N bond construction. Then the possible amino  acids relating to the binding of OPD (1) in P450<sub>S18</sub> were analyzed. Furthermore,  we used alanine scanning, crude enzyme reaction activity screening to find  variants with higher catalytic activities. Finally, the selected variants were  purified and their catalytic efficiencies were measured, in which F295A, P246A,  F176A, F292A, F82A, and Q88A showed 1.5-3.5-fold increased activity (Fig 1)"},{"location":"materials_and_methods/","title":"Materials and MethodsMaterialsBacterial strains, plasmids, and culture conditionsDNA isolation and manipulationSite-directed mutagenesis of P450<sub>S18</sub>Expression of P450S18 variantsIn vitro assays","text":"General chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd.
