<h1>In vitro activity of P450<sub>S18</sub></h1>
&nbsp&nbsp Using the CYP152 family P450 enzyme P450<sub>SPα</sub> as the probe, a homolog 
protein P450<sub>S18</sub> was successfully identified from a deepsea-derived 
microorganism. We then amplified the sequences encoding P450<sub>S18</sub>, and 
cloned it into pET28a. The soluble form of P450<sub>S18</sub> (48.4 KDa) were obtained 
in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (Fig S1). We then tested the catalytic activities 
of P450<sub>S18</sub> toward different small molecule compounds containing benzene 
rings (Fig S2), using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as the cofactor. Surprisingly, in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, 
P450<sub>S18</sub> could transform OPD (1) to 2,3-diaminophenazine (2) (Fig 2). 
Phenazines are a class of heterocyclic nitrogenous aromatics featuring a 
dibenzopytazine core.[13] These compounds displayed a wide range of 
bioactivities, including antimicrobial, antifungal, antitumor, etc.
[13]
It is reported 
that the formation of natural phenazines need multiple steps and enzymes.[14]
While P450<sub>S18</sub> could transform OPD (1) to 2,3-diaminophenazine (2) directly 
through C‒N bond construction, demonstrating its potential use for phenazines 
construction. Therefore, we next engineered P450<sub>S18</sub> for better catalytic 
activities toward the substrate OPD (1).</div>
