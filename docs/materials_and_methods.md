# Materials and Methods

<div class="content">

<h1>Materials</h1>

General chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Sangon
Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). High-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) was performed on an Agilent 1260 Infinity apparatus with a diode array
detector (DAD). HPLC-MS experiments were performed on Agilent 1290 HPLC
system coupled with a Thermo Electron LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer.
All chemicals and solvents were of analytical or chromatographic grade. The
resuspended cells were lysed by an ultrasonic processors VCX750 (Sonics and
Materials Inc, PA, USA). Common biochemicals and chemicals were purchased
from standard sources for laboratory use.

<h1>Bacterial strains, plasmids, and culture conditions</h1>

All strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplemental Table S2.
Escherichia coli DH5α was used for general cloning. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE<sub>3</sub>)
was used as a host for protein expression. E. coli strains were routinely cultured
in Luria–Bertani (LB) liquid medium at 37 °C, 220 rpm, or LB agar plate at 37 °C.
When appropriate, kanamycin (Kan; 100 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>
for E. coli) was added to the medium.

<h1>DNA isolation and manipulation</h1>>

DNA manipulations were performed using standard procedures or the
manufacturer’s protocols for <i>E. coli</i>. Plasmid extraction, DNA purification and
gel extraction were carried out using commercial kits (Omega Biotech Co., Ltd.,
Beijing, China). Oligonucleotide synthesis and DNA sequencing were
performed at Tsingke Biotech Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). PCR reactions were
carried out using Pfu DNA polymerase (TIANGEN Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing,
China).

<h1>Site-directed mutagenesis of P450<sub>S18</sub></h1>

The reverse complementary primers with mutation sites were designed and
listed in Table S2. The pET28a plasmids carrying P450<sub>S18</sub> gene with mutation
sites was linearized by reverse PCR using 2 × Phanta® Flash Master Mix DNA
polymerase. The linear plasmids were ligated to circular molecules by seamless
cloning using ClonExpress® Ultra One Step Cloning Kit (Nanjing, China). The
introduced mutations were verified by DNA sequencing.

<h1>Expression of P450S18 variants</h1>
Single colonies of <i>E. coil</i> BL21 (DE<sub>3</sub>) strain containing protein expression 
vectors were inoculated were inoculated in 100 μL of LB supplemented with 
100 μg/mL kanamycin in 96-well plates and grown at 37 °C for 12 h. Then, 2% 
of the <i>E. coli</i> culture volume was transferred to 500 μL of LB supplemented with 
100 μg/mL kanamycin in a 1.5 mL microtube and grown to an optical density at 
OD600 of 0.5–0.6 at 37 °C and 220 rpm. Next, protein expression was induced 
overnight by the addition of 0.2 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside 
(IPTG) and culturing at 16 °C and 220 rpm. After centrifugation of the cultures 
at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C for 5 min, the resulting cell pellets were resuspended 
in 100 μL of bacterial protein extraction reagent (Cell Biolabs Inc., San Diego, 
CA, USA), incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and centrifuged at 
12,000×g for 10 min. The resulting supernatants were used as the crude 
enzyme.

<h1>In vitro assays</h1>

A typical reaction (50 μL) consists of OPD (1 mM), H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (20 mM), P450<sub>S18</sub> in
Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C
for 2 h, and were quenched by the addition of ACN (50 μL), and the denatured
protein was removed by centrifugation. The assays were monitored by HPLC
analysis, using a C18, YMC pack ODS-AQ column (5 μm, 150 × 4.6 mm) with
UV detection at 260 nm with a gradient program (0-5 min, 10% B; 5-20 min,
10 % to 25 % B; 20 - 35 min, 100% B; 1 mL min<sup>-1</sup>
).
